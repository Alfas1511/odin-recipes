    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with
      rich sauces, cheeses, and various fillings, then baking it to perfection.
      Traditionally, it features layers of béchamel or ricotta cheese, a hearty
      meat sauce made with ground beef or sausage, tomato sauce, and a generous
      topping of mozzarella and Parmesan. The combination of flavors and
      textures—soft pasta, creamy cheese, and savory sauce—makes lasagna a
      comforting and satisfying meal that’s perfect for family gatherings or
      special occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the traditional version is beloved worldwide, lasagna has many
      delicious variations. Vegetarian versions often substitute meat with
      roasted vegetables, spinach, or lentils, while some recipes use different
      cheeses or even seafood. Whether served in a cozy home kitchen or an
      elegant restaurant, lasagna remains a symbol of warmth, togetherness, and
      the comforting essence of Italian cuisine.

    <h3>Steps for preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h4>Prepare the Meat Sauce</h4></li>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>
          Add ground beef or sausage, cooking until browned. Drain excess fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper,
          and Italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme).
        </li>
        <li>
          Simmer for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce
          thickens and flavors blend.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <li><h4>Prepare the Cheese Mixture</h4></li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 1 beaten egg, half of the shredded
          mozzarella, grated Parmesan, and chopped parsley.
        </li>
        <li>Season lightly with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
      </ol>

      <li><h4>Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4></li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Boil lasagna sheets in salted water according to package directions
          until al dente.
        </li>
        <li>Drain and lay them flat on a clean towel to prevent sticking.</li>
      </ol>

      <li><h4>Assemble the Lasagna</h4></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Grease a baking dish with butter or olive oil.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>
          Add a layer of noodles, then spread ricotta mixture, followed by meat
          sauce, and mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a
          generous layer of sauce and cheese on top.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li><h4>Bake</h4></li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cover with foil (lightly sprayed with cooking oil to prevent
          sticking).
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 25–30 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Remove foil and bake an additional 10–15 minutes, until the cheese is
          bubbly and golden.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li><h4>Serve</h4></li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before cutting—this helps it
          set.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, and serve warm.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
